# TSBox-AES
This is a project from Security Engineering class. The purpose is to implement a new encryption algorithm based on existing ones. 

## How it should work
We want to use columnar transposition cipher on S-box, from AES algorithm, using AES key. This should make our encryption stronger, since the result will be more dependent of key.
